        <p>This speedometer is designed by putting it on images and videos that involve driving. In this example, the speedometer is used for a car, separating the speed into increments of 25-40 mph with a max speed of 100-160 mph.
          I also set up the speedometer in km/h and included yellow and red sections to alert you to the dangers of going at a very high speed. It also applies to trains but has three different categories with different max speeds.
          There were three options of a train speedometer, with a max speed of 80, 100, and 220 mph. The speedometer diagram was used to simulate recorded videos and estimate photos.</p>
        <p>The speedometer has three signal words: warning, danger, and peril. It applies to cars and trains.</p>
        <p>All caps were used for road conditions, while the exclamation mark was added for emergencies and sudden traffic slowdowns.</p>

        <p></p> On this website, I'm going to talk about location formatting. I found some examples related to location formatting, which can be shown here:
        <h3>Locations in the United States</h3>
        <p>In some cases, a full address is provided when a building is in the photo:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">1137 4th Street, San Rafael, CA 94901</p>
        <p>Involving street names or neighborhoods:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Crenshaw, Los Angeles, CA</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Binz Engleman Road, Kirby, TX</p>
      </div>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Involving counties or cities:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Marin County, CA</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Piqua, Ohio</p>
        <p>Involving buildings or natural places:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Willis Tower, Chicago, IL 60606</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Silver Spring station, Maryland</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">East Fairmont Park, Philadelphia, PA</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Danger Cave, Utah</p>

          <h3>Locations in France</h3>
          <p>In France, place names were sorted by canton, Arrondissement, department, and region. To prevent a long name, I omitted cantons and Arrondissements. There were 101 departments, 333 Arrondissements, and 2,054 cantons.</p>
          <p>Since there were too many Arrondissements to show, the department Loire has three Arrondissements, 21 cantons, and 323 communes with a population of 769,029 and an area of 1,846 square miles. Instead of:</p>
          <p class="Splatoon2">Ouches, Renaison, Roanne, Loire, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes</p>
          <p>We can use:</p>
          <p class="Splatoon2">Ouches, Loire, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes</p>
          <p>Some communes were named after Arrondissements, so it was straightforward to communes like Melun.</p>
          <p class="Splatoon2">Melun, Seine-et-Marne, Île-de-France</p>
          <p>Some departments were named after rivers, while others were named after cities or names used in historical situations.</p>

        <h3>Locations in Japan</h3>
        <p>In Japan, place names were sorted by city, town, or village, followed by the prefecture. If you put <span style="font-family:times new roman">Ii station</span>, it will result in:</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman,SimSun;">Ii station, Hagi, Yamaguchi (山口県萩市飯井駅)</p>
        <p>Otherwise, there are several places of the same name, so it was separated by city or prefecture, like Ōsaki (大崎) in Miyagi and Tokyo prefectures and Ōmiya (大宮) in Saitama and variants in Ibaraki and Miyazaki prefectures.</p>
        <p>Due to confusion between Chinese and Japanese, the long vowel was added in some cases, like Hanyu Pinyin and Hanyū (羽生) in Saitama. Otherwise, the formatting looked like the same.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman,SimSun;">Kesennuma, Miyagi (宮城県気仙沼市)</p>

        <h3>Location formatting in video games</h3>
        <p>Some games have locations. In the Super Mario series, I put the location by using the world number and the level number, and I sometimes put names in it. In Kirby series,
          I have to put the level name and number. In Splatoon, I can put the stage name, and outside of the stages, I will put the location name.</p>

        <h3>Locations in the <i>Philip</i>pines</h3>
        <p>In the <i>Philip</i>pines, cities were sorted by [city name], [province]. The region and the barangays were optional, like:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">San Pablo, Laguna</p>
        <p>In Manila and Quezon City, the word <i>Philip</i>pines were used instead.</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Santa Cruz, Manilla, <i>Philip</i>pines</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Quezon City, <i>Philip</i>pines</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Locations in China</h3>
        <p>In China, the format was [village], [district], [city], [province]. For example:</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman,SimSun;">Sijiu, Taicheng, Taishan, Guangdong (广东省台山市四九区)</p>
        <p>In Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, and Tianjin, the word China was added instead.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman,SimSun;">Beijing, China (北京)</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman,SimSun;">Baoshan, Shanghai, China (上海市宝山区)</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong and Macau, it was formatted as [village], [region], [province]. For example:</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman,SimSun;">Cotai, Macau, China</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman,SimSun;">Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China</p>

        <h3>Locations in Vietnam</h3>
        <p>Like the formatting of locations in France, they still use communes, but it was formatted as [village], [district], [province]. For example:</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman;">Trường Sơn, Sầm Sơn, Thanh Hóa</p>
        <p>In Ho Chi Minh, Hanoi, and Haiphong, the word Vietnam was added unless a district exists in these cities.</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman;">Hanoi, Vietnam</p>
        <p style="font-family:Calibri,times new roman;">Cát Hải, Haiphong, Vietnam</p>

    <h3>Sacramento Effect</h3>
      <p>This word that I made up was called the Sacramento Effect because I was playing <a href="/gaming/splatoon.htm">Splatoon 3</a> turf war match when a deviation of +/- 15%
      triggered how the team was way behind, but in some cases, the turfing coverage was unstable and the team that was behind can make a comeback within 10-30 seconds because of
    team effort. I looked on <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a> and X some of the time about this common sighting.</p>
    <p>It was called this because of how the door buttons were sounding once the Sacramento light rail train makes a full stop in a station. When the door closes, the beeping was heard.
      I commonly heard the beeping noise of the CAF light rail trains.
