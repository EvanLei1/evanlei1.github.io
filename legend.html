        <p>This speedometer is designed by putting it on images and videos that involve driving. In this example, the speedometer is used for a car, separating the speed into increments of 25-40 mph with a max speed of 100-160 mph.
          I also set up the speedometer in km/h and included yellow and red sections to alert you to the dangers of going at a very high speed. It also applies to trains but has three different categories with different max speeds.
          There were three options of a train speedometer, with a max speed of 80, 100, and 220 mph. The speedometer diagram was used to simulate recorded videos and estimate photos.</p>
        <p>The speedometer has three signal words: warning, danger, and peril. It applies to cars and trains.</p>
        <p>All caps were used for road conditions, while the exclamation mark was added for emergencies and sudden traffic slowdowns.</p>

    <h3>Sacramento Effect</h3>
      <p>This word that I made up was called the Sacramento Effect because I was playing <a href="/gaming/splatoon.htm">Splatoon 3</a> turf war match when a deviation of +/- 15%
      triggered how the team was way behind, but in some cases, the turfing coverage was unstable and the team that was behind can make a comeback within 10-30 seconds because of
    team effort. I looked on <a href="https://twitch.tv">Twitch</a> and X some of the time about this common sighting.</p>
    <p>It was called this because of how the door buttons were sounding once the Sacramento light rail train makes a full stop in a station. When the door closes, the beeping was heard.
      I commonly heard the beeping noise of the CAF light rail trains.
