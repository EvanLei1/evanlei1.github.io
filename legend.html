        <p>This speedometer is designed by putting it on images and videos that involve driving. In this example, the speedometer is used for a car, separating the speed into increments of 40 mph with a max speed of 160 mph.
          I also set up the speedometer in km/h and included yellow and red sections to alert you to the dangers of going at a very high speed. It also applies to trains but has three different categories with different max speeds.
          Unlike the car speedometer figure, the train speedometer figure does not have yellow or red sections. The speedometer diagram was used to simulate recorded videos and estimate photos.</p>
        <p>The speedometer has three signal words: warning, danger, and peril. It only applies to cars, not trains. For the train speedometer, the bottom part was used for the target speed with a white background.</p>
        <p>All caps were used for road conditions, while the exclamation mark was added for emergencies and sudden traffic slowdowns.</p>

        <p></p> On this website, I'm going to talk about location formatting. I found some examples related to location formatting, which can be shown here:
        <h3>Locations in the United States</h3>
        <p>In some cases, a full address is provided when a building is in the photo:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">1137 4th Street, San Rafael, CA 94901</p>
        <p>Involving street names or neighborhoods:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Crenshaw, Los Angeles, CA 90016</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Binz Engleman Road, Kirby, TX</p>
        <p>Involving counties or cities:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Marin County, CA</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Piqua, Ohio</p>
        <p>Involving buildings or natural places:</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Willis Tower, Chicago, IL 60606</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Silver Spring station, Maryland</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">East Fairmont Park, Philadelphia, PA</p>
        <p class="Splatoon2">Danger Cave, Utah</p>

          <h3>Locations in France</h3>
          <p>In France, place names were sorted by canton, Arrondissement, department, and region. To prevent a long name, I omitted cantons and Arrondissements. There were 101 departments, 333 Arrondissements, and 2,054 cantons.</p>
          <p>Since there were too many Arrondissements to show, the department Loire has three Arrondissements, 21 cantons, and 323 communes with a population of 769,029 and an area of 1,846 square miles. Instead of:</p>
          <p class="Splatoon2">Ouches, Renaison, Roanne, Loire, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes</p>
          <p>We can use:</p>
          <p class="Splatoon2">Ouches, Loire, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes</p>
          <p>Some communes were named after Arrondissements, so it was straightforward to communes like Melun.</p>
          <p class="Splatoon2">Melun, Seine-et-Marne, Île-de-France</p>
          <p>Some departments were named after rivers, while others were named after cities or names used in historical situations.</p>
