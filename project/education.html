    <h2 id="APCSP">AP Computer Science Principles project</h2>
    <p>This project was taught in the only AP Computer Science class in high school in the 2022-23 school year. <br>
      When I did the project, I asked users to list between 3 and 10 apps, remove the app names from this Python code,<br>
      and after the three remaining names were displayed, or the user inputs "done," the final list was sorted alphabetically
      and prints it out.</p>

      # This variable can create an empty list of apps
      app_list = []

      # User inputs the ten most favorite apps
      def favorite_app_response():
        # Set the number of apps in order from 1
        num_apps = 0
        # Input a question with an explanation when you are done
        print("What is your favorite apps? Enter the response up to 10 times unless you input 'done.'")
        # Asks the app name 10 times, increasing its order after each response
        while num_apps < 10:
          # App number order from 1 to 10
          num_apps += 1
          # Asks the question about what is the most favorite app
          app_response = input("App name " + str(num_apps) + ": ")
          # Adds the favorite app input into the list, one by one
          app_list.append(app_response)
          # if the user inputs "done," the loop will end early
          if app_response == 'done':
              # Removes the "done" because we don't want to put it in the list
              app_list.remove("done")
              # The input repeats until three responses were filled in and returns a response
              # with the first three apps or more
              while num_apps > 3 and num_apps < 10:
                  return "There are " + str(num_apps - 1) + " apps in the list: "

    <h2 id="WRI 001">Dorothea Puente Case Study</h2>
    <p>In my college writing class at the University of California, Merced (WRI 001), I wrote a final project that involved writing a case study of Dorothea Puente. It was assigned by the instructor Cindy Chavez,<br>
    who teaches writing classes, was involved in a car accident a day before school started on August 23, 2023. She held the entire semester online, with the option of meeting in person (a <i>hyflex</i> class). </p>
