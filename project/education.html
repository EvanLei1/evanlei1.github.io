    <h2 id="APCSP">AP Computer Science Principles project</h2>
    <p>This project was taught in the only AP Computer Science class in high school in the 2022-23 school year. <br>
      When I did the project, I asked users to list between 3 and 10 apps, remove the app names from this Python code,<br>
      and after the three remaining names were displayed, or the user inputs "done," the final list was sorted alphabetically
      and prints it out.</p>
    <h2 id="WRI 001">Dorothea Puente Case Study</h2>
    <p>In my college writing class at the University of California, Merced (WRI 001), I wrote a final project that involved writing a case study of Dorothea Puente. It was assigned by the instructor Cindy Chavez,<br>
    who teaches writing classes, was involved in a car accident a day before school started on August 23, 2023. She held the entire semester online, with the option of meeting in person (a <i>hyflex</i> class). </p>
