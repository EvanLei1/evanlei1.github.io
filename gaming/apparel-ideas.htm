      <p>In 2019, I started a list of clothing ideas that made me shocked and interested because these hoodies looked cuter than before. In mid-2019, I saw people wearing Fortnite skin hoodies, which is newly introduced at that time,
    and contained colors that looked vibrant to me, including the Minecraft hoodie. Before that, I researched kid's raincoats, full zip-up hoodies, and other ideas that found me interesting. In 2020, I researched hats because some of it were colorful.</p>
      <p style="font-family:helvetica, arial;">I found some research prior to 2020: the Volcom zip-up hoodies were discontinued in circa 2017, and the Fortnite hoodies popped up in mid-2019.<br>
      I bought the <span style="color:#1EB219">Fortnite</span> <span style="color:#FF5819">Rex hoodie</span> on the last day of September 2019. At that time, there were
      six or seven different kinds of Fortnite hoodies, discontinued between August 2020 and May 2022. I still have the hoodie today.</p>
      <p>In 2021, I started researching Sonic the Hedgehog hoodies found on Amazon that have an eye mask and (six quills and two ears), resembling Sonic.
      The Tails hoodie was released in the summer 2022, followed by Knuckles and Shadow in summer 2023. Two Sonic puffer jackets were found: one version was made in late 2022
      while the other one showed up in mid-2024. It distinguishes the quality between the Target version (no eye mask) and the Amazon version. Sonic hooded shirt
      was also there, but it was sold for one year in 2022-23.</p>
      <p>I have an interest on buying the Pikachu hat since 2020. There were several occasions of people wearing Pikachu hats between June 2022 and August 2023. 
      There were different versions of hats, sold on either Amazon, H&M, Hobby Lobby, Spencer's, etc. The older version of the hat is no longer sold, I have seen a lot 
      on eBay and Poshmark for thrifting. The beanie was also sold in various stores, but I saw them on Target for three months (10/2023-1/2024).</p>
      <p>I was also researching about Minecraft hoodies. It was the most popular hoodie because it was green, and was sold since circa 2018. I found notorious problems
      with the hoodie sold at Target because of the two-way zipper: it easily stops working or breaks. I bought it on Goodwill on August 29, 2024 and realized that the zipper doesn't work. I fixed the zipper and bought it.</p>
      <p>The research also applies by using reverse image searches like Google Lens, and cropping the image of the product. However, it's not accurate; some photos were marked
      "Results of people are limited."</p>
