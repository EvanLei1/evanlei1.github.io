<h3>Stanislaus Regional Transit Authority</h3>

<h3>Santa Cruz Metro</h3>
<p>Santa Cruz Metro has a lot of buses purchased seconhand from other transit agencies. For example, four 2300 series buses were replaced by the
    110xx series while the xx23 series buses replaced the 2800 series buses operating on Highway 17 Express. The 110xx series were New Flyer XN60
    buses bought from San Diego MTS (only 1105, 1111, 1113, and 1121 were active as of November 25, 2024). Santa Cruz Metro permanently wrap these buses in 
    ORAT livery and added the 0 in the middle, which were 11012, 11018-11019, 11022-11023, and 11025-11028.
</p>
<p>There were speculations and images of buses bought secondhand by SCMTD. Several ex-OCTA New Flyer C40LFR units were discovered and were unnumbered. It was used to replace
    the 9800 and 2200 series, while the 15 ex-RTA 31300 series buses will replace the 2600 and 2800 series.
