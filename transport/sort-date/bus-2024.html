    <h3 class="Splatoon1">Final BART legacy train run</h3>
      <p class="Splatoon2">On April 20, 2024, Bay Area Rapid Transit held a special event commemorating the final three train sets made by Rohr between 1971 and 1979, which include a special route from Oakland's MacArthur
        and Fremont stations. It was a unique experience for me, as I rode the second train. The second final train arrived at 3:09 pm, and the final train arrived at 3:25 pm. The final train left Fremont station at 3:35 pm.</p>
      <p>I was in car 1584 on the second set. The first set was reserved because it was a five-car formation, while the last two sets were available for the general public. In MacArthur, special events were held, like the speeches
      and the usage of the front end of a preserved BART A cab and train controls. I did not take a selfie at this event. After this event, a few legacy trains were preserved.</p>
      <h4>Train sets involved</h4>

    <h3 class="Splatoon1">Golden Gate Transit Route 172</h3>
      <p class="Splatoon2">On June 6, 2024, I took the Golden Gate Transit bus from SF to Santa Rosa from 2:16 to 4:26 pm, with traffic increasing the travel time on three occasions,
        primarily between Novato San Marin Dr and Petaluma Blvd. Then, I took the CityBus to Coddingtown Mall, before taking the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit to San Rafael. I took pics of
        Marin Transit buses before I return to SF. Golden Gate Transit Route 172 skips the entire Marin County, which runs during weekday peak hours in one direction in the morning and evening.</p>
      <p>A few images of Marin County Airport (Gnoss Field) were taken from the GGT bus on U.S. 101 during heavy traffic at 3:30 pm. Later on, when I rode the SMART train, I retook photos
of the airport. On June 23, I took pictures of San Rafael Airport from the hill, which included a plane landing. It is one of two airports in Marin County, all with a single runway, and were locally controlled.</p>
