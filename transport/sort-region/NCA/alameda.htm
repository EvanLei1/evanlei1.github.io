    <h1>Central Contra Costa Transit Authority</h1>
    <p>The entire bus fleet was based on Gillig vehicles. There were ten 2013 Gillig BRT 40', seven 2014 Gillig Low Floor 29', 24 2015 Gillig BRT 40' (1509-1532), 13 2017 Gillig Low Floor 35' and 14 29', and 40 2023 Gillig Low Floor 40'. Eight Gillig Low Floor EV 29' buses
      were made in 2016-18, of which four were trolley replicas. The latest buses has an Allison transmission, replacing nine 2010 Gillig BRT HEV 40' with Voith transmission and 31 2009-10 standard BRT buses.</p>
    <h1>Western Contra Costa Transit Authority</h1>
    <p>Most of the fleet were made up of Gillig BRT vehicles from 2013 to 2024, like 20 35' buses in the 100 series and 16 40' buses in the 400 series. There were six MCI D4500CT and two Prevost X3-45 buses in the 200 series from 2008 to 2015, of which bus 202 caught fire.
      Buses 205 and 206 were ex-demos. 4 MCI D45 CRT LE buses were delivered to replace the 4 oldest buses. There were 3 ADL Enviro500 buses in the 600 series.</p>
    <h1>Livermore Amador Valley Transit Authority</h1>
    <p>The entire bus fleet was based on Gillig BRT HEV buses. All four 2011 buses in the 1100 series were active. There were ten 35' and ten 40' buses delivered in 2016, 11 40' and 9 29' buses in 2017,
      and 16 40' buses in 2022. These buses replaced the remaining 2003 40' buses, two 2007 29' buses, and most of the 2009 29' and 40' buses.</p>
    <h1>Union City Transit</h1>
    <p>Most of the buses were operated using 2012 and 2016 Gillig Low Floor CNG 35' buses, with a few Orion VII NG CNG buses remaining. The entire fleet will be replaced
      by electric buses in the future.
    <h1>Dumbarton Express</h1>
    <p>All buses were Gillig Low Floor units similar to AC Transit since it was transferred to independent. This agency only ran during weekdays.
    </p>
    <h1>Tri Delta Transit</h1>
    <p>Most of the buses were Gillig BRT 40' made in 2012, 2016, 2018, and 2023, and several electric buses that ran only during weekdays, like Proterra Catalyst and BYD K9.
      The 0990 series retired in late 2023.

    <h1>Buses to Look Out for</h1>
    <b>This section was updated on Saturday, November 8, 2025.</b>
    <p>The 1200 series were retired in early 2024 by the late 1600 series. The 6000 series were replaced by the 6300 series by late 2023. The 5100 series were active,
        but I don't know when it will be replaced. Most 5100 series were retired in 2023.<br>
        The articulated Van Hool buses were primarily assigned to lines 52 (weekdays) and 57. The small Van Hool buses were assigned to lines 65, 67 and 216 during weekdays. These buses
        rarely see service during the weekends.<br>
        The 1700 series entered service in early February 2025, replacing 50 of 65 2012-2013 Gillig Low Floor buses.
