    <h1 align="center">Hello there!</h1>
    <img src="/profile-pic.jpg" align="right" width="100">
    <p>My name is Evan Lei, and I am currently a second-year Computer Science and Engineering major at UC Merced. 
    I like running, biking, and taking public transit across the San Francisco Bay Area. Other than doing exercise, 
    I like to play video games and sometimes stream them on Twitch, 
    like Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, Splatoon 3, and other Nintendo Switch games.</p>
