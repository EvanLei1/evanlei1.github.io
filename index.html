    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <p>My name is Evan Lei, and I am currently a second-year Computer Science and Engineering major at UC Merced. 
    I like to run, bike, and take public transit across the San Francisco Bay Area. Other than doing exercise, 
    I like to play video games and sometimes stream them on Twitch, 
    like Pokemon Scarlet/Violet, Splatoon 3, and other Nintendo Switch games.</p>

        <p class="Splatoon2">Taken at 4th Street, San Rafael, towards the right side of the SMART station</p>
        <p style="font-size:9px">This is one of a few stations in California, and the only one in the SMART system, 
        to put <big><span style="background-color:red">Danger: </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confined_Space" style="color:black">Confined Space</a></big>
        on both platforms. There were two side platforms in San Rafael station surrounded by two streets, and the transit center is directly across the platform to the south.</p>

        <p>When damage was taken by the opponent, I got splatted <b>directly</b> by the Ink Storm by immediate contact of the storm.</p>
        <p>The Tacticooler reduced the respawn time, and the camera glitches, causing discontinuity to the other player splatted,
        zoomed in as the other player respawned.</p>
